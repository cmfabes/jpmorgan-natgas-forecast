Natural Gas Storage & Forward Price Simulation

This project explores how seasonal storage patterns influence natural-gas forward pricing. It’s based on a quantitative simulation originally built for a JP Morgan virtual experience, then refined into a clearer, self-contained notebook.

The workflow uses historical spot prices and storage data to:

Model seasonality and cyclical inventory behavior

Estimate how storage deviations impact pricing pressure

Generate 12-month forward price paths

Visualize scenarios that mirror common risk-management and research workflows

The notebook stays focused on practical interpretation, not over-engineering. It shows the logic behind each step, the reasoning for parameter choices, and the effects those choices have on projected outcomes.
